#Sparkle Turntable Bot

A customizable Turntable.fm bot written in node.js utilizing [ttapi](https://github.com/alaingilbert/Turntable-API).

Note (5/25/12): Starting in June, I won't be able to devote a lot of time to this project. I'll continue to fix reported bugs and merge in pull requests, though.

## Installation

    npm install sparklebot

Check out the new [Get Started guide](https://github.com/sharedferret/Sparkle-Turntable-Bot/wiki/Get-Started) over on the project's [Wiki page](https://github.com/sharedferret/Sparkle-Turntable-Bot/wiki) for detailed installation instructions.

## Features

This bot is written in Node.JS and utilizes Alain Gilbert's Turntable API.

The bot can: 

* Respond to a set of commands in chat and through turntable's PM system
* Awesome songs based on various systems
* Log vote, chat, song, and room events in the console
* Report song stats in chat after each song
* Welcome users to the room via chat and PM
* Enforce room rules regarding song limits and timeouts before a person can DJ again
* Log song statistics and chat entries in a MySQL database
* Receive and respond to commands via a HTTP RESTful API
* Manage a waitlist/queue for a room

## Help

If you have a **nontrivial** question, feel free to contact me. I'm usually hanging out in the [Indie/Classic Alt 1+Done room](http://turntable.fm/indieclassic_alternative_1_done) on Turntable.
